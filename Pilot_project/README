This pilot project generates a random "true tree", then squashes branch lengths randomly for 20 replicates, simulates alignments, and reconstructs with iqtree. 
These are the 20 input "gene" trees. 
The input trees are used to make 4 supertrees: MRP, SR2008, SPA, QPA.
MRP made using paup (not shown) 
Supertree support and RF values from "true tree" can be calculated.
