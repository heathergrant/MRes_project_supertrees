#This pilot project generates a random "true tree", then squashes branch lengths for 20 replicates, simulates alignments, and  
#reconstructs the alignments with iqtree. These are the 20 input "gene" trees. 
#The input trees are used to make 4 supertrees: MRP, SR2008, SPA, QPA.
#Supertree support and RF values from "true tree" can be calculated.
